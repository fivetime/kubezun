// Package netpol turns Kubernetes NetworkPolicy into what a Neutron port can
// carry, and refuses — loudly — the parts it cannot carry.
//
// The shape of the answer comes from one fact about OVN: an ACL attaches to a
// Logical_Switch or a Port_Group, and there is no Address_Set.acls column. An
// address set is what a rule MATCHES; a port group is where a rule HANGS. So a
// policy's subject — which pods it isolates — rides the port's security group
// list, and a policy's peers ride address groups. See DESIGN §7.7.
//
// The refusals are the important half. A policy this cannot express must never
// come out wider than what was asked for: a dropped `except` turns a narrowing
// into a widening, and an unresolved named port turns "port 8080" into "all of
// tcp". Where something cannot be expressed, the traffic it would have allowed
// stays denied and the reason is reported. Narrower than asked is a visible
// failure; wider than asked is a silent one.
